    (name of developer listed in brackets)

plone.app.i18n - 1.0.5 Unreleased

    - Changed the language selector viewlet to use the native name instead of
      always showing the English name. This closes
      http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7103.
      [hannosch]

    - Allow tests to force display of selector viewlet by setting
      always_show_selector = True on the portal_languages tool.

plone.app.i18n - 1.0.4 Released April 19, 2008

    - Make the language selector deal with languages for which no flag is
      defined. Ported over from LinguaPlone.
      [wichert]


plone.app.i18n - 1.0.3 Released January 31, 2008

    - Fixed bug: all available languages in the languageselector box were
      always marked as selected, at least when using language cookies. In
      practice this meant the last language was always shown in the box and
      this language was actually never used and could not be set.

    - Added more tests. 100% test coverage now.
      [hannosch]

    - Added more tests for language and countries utilities. Fixed some
      call-by-reference bugs with lists found while writing those.
      [hannosch]

plone.app.i18n - 1.0.2 Released January 9, 2008

    - Undo the damage from r17682 which removed the language code from the
      return value of LanguageSelector.languages. This broke the language
      selectors, which is mostly noticeable by LinguaPlone no longer working.
      [wichert]

      is enabled.

      viewlet to be more defensive, when there's no language tool available.
